- possible improvements
	- case insensitive activator object-script name matching
	- configurable name matching "starts with" or "contains"
	- add variable validation (log read access of non-existing variables instead of silently returning a default value)
	- local variables are bound to an object, but we should have metadata for debugging which global variables a script reads, and which ones it changes (or may change)
