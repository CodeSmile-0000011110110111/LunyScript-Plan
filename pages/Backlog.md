- DONE [[Refactor LunyScript]] API #lunyscript
- LATER [[Lifecycle]] blocks with events (create/destroy, enable/disable) #lunyscript
- LATER [[Lifecycle]] create/enable engine API for regular code #lunyscript
	- Note: to fire LunyScript internal events eg Object.Destroy(x) => LunyObject.Destroy(x)
- LATER Lifecycle concerns
	- Enabled state change should call OnEnable/OnDisable to child LunyObjects as well
- LATER [[Event Handling Blocks]] foundation (eg Input, Collision, SendMessage, etc) #lunyscript
- LATER [[Diagnostics]] LunyScript Profiling Hooks for profiling individual scripts and runnables #lunyscript
- LATER [[Diagnostics]] Debug Blocks should not be filtered out in release builds (not executing)
