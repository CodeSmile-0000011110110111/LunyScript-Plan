## Design
	- NOW User asked if scripts can be sandboxed - consider what's needed

		- Limit access to: Objects in scene (root + children), Assets, and API features
		- Filtering: by tag/group/label, by asset/scene path or name
- ## Lifecycle concerns
	- LATER [[Lifecycle]] register/create/enable API methods for regular code #lunyscript
		- Note: to fire LunyScript internal events eg Object.Destroy(x) => LunyObject.Destroy(x)
		- LATER create object via API and register it (should activate script if exists)
		- LATER get and destroy registered object via API
	- LATER update methods should not run when object is disabled in hierarchy (unregister handlers or check every frame?)
	- LATER need to handle LunyObject parenting (including a hierarchy with "gaps")
- ## LunyEngine Concerns
	- LATER provide an awaitable "GetInstance()" to ensure there won't be a "ctor is too early, 'ready' is too late" scenario
- ## LunyObject Concerns
- ## EngineService Concerns
	- ### SceneService Concerns
		- LATER GetAllObjects() converts every object to a LunyObject wrapper! This should only do so for objects for which we have LunyScripts.
		- LATER GetSingleObject, convert to LunyObject if necessary, return proxy otherwise
		- LATER test scene (re-)load
			- LATER hook up to scene service callbacks and use the accordingly
			- LATER create ReloadScene block
- ## Failsafe Concerns
	- LATER return valid "error" objects
- ## Cleanup Concerns
- ## Event Concerns
	- LATER pass scene name (general: passing event parameters to blocks)
- ## LunyScript Concerns
	- LATER Implement Every.TimeInterval
	- LATER [[Conditional Blocks]] (if/else) #lunyscript
	- LATER [[Composite Blocks]] (loops, timers, coroutines) #lunyscript
	- LATER [[LunyScript Hot Reload]] with manual triggers #lunyscript
- ## Other Concerns
	- LATER [[Event Handling Blocks]] foundation (eg Input, Collision, SendMessage, etc) #lunyscript
	- LATER [[Diagnostics]] LunyScript Profiling Hooks for profiling individual scripts and runnables #lunyscript
	- LATER Diagnostics add internal verbose logging with log levels (perhaps categories for filtering?)
	- DONE [[Diagnostics]] Debug Blocks should be filtered out in release builds (not executing)
	- LATER [[Variable Blocks]] #lunyscript
	- LATER [[Testing Infrastructure]] #luny #lunyscript
	- LATER [[Resource Addressing]] (eg LunyUrl) #luny
	- LATER [[Lua Integration]] #luny
	- DONE Disable Editor-only blocks (create EDITOR define, return no-op block, skip null blocks)
	- LATER Variables refactor to Vars.Global[] and maybe Vars.G[] as alias
- ## Testing Concerns
	-
-
-
- possible improvements
	- case insensitive activator object-script name matching
	- configurable name matching "starts with" or "contains"
	- add variable validation (log read access of non-existing variables instead of silently returning a default value)
	- local variables are bound to an object, but we should have metadata for debugging which global variables a script reads, and which ones it changes (or may change)
