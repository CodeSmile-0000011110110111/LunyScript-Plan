- With LunyScript, I'm not just creating a beginner-friendly declarative, block-based C# gameplay programming API that avoids technical jargon.
- To make it work across professional game engines - Godot and Unity at first - I have to create an engine abstraction framework called "Luny". Luny serves as a cross-engine SDK for other developers too.
- Creating such a portable C# framework may seem like an impossible task but it's not. It's been done before by web frameworks like NodeJS and by standards like OpenXR.
