- Epics are Features and Todos that are broad in scope and typically lack design and requirements analysis.
-
- ## Unit Testing
	- DONE Cross-Engine automatable Unit Test setup
		- create test project that includes agnostic submodules
		- add EngineLifecycleAdapter Mock
- ## Reflective API
	- see reflective API.md in RFC project
	- serializing as Lua table
	- to be designed
		- capability contracts
		- load time validation
- ## Repository Structure
	- Consider Refactor: LunyEngine as separate package from LunyScript package? Other frameworks may share the dependency
	- Future: lightweight 'package manager' for LunyEngine frameworks (versions, dependencies)
- ## Hot Reload
	- For both C# and Lua scripts
- ## Lua integration
	- Custom code generator probably best compatible option
- ## Sandboxed Script Execution
	- Filters and filter callbacks for Asset & Scene service
	- API filters (Lua: blacklist/whitelist, C#: probably writing a custom sandbox service)
- ## On-Screen Diagnostics
	- What gets displayed, where and how?
	- What services will be needed
- ## Cross-Engine Editor Tooling
	- Needs analysis of each engine's capabilities and what the goal should be for LunyScript.
	- Would it make sense to have custom importers, build scripts, editor windows, settings menus, etc?
- ## Developer SDK Documentation
	- How to write custom observers, and what you can do with it
	- Extend Service APIs - both for public consumption and personal use
	- How to add support for another engine (steps + details)
		- repository setup
	- Behavioural contracts
	- Engine behavioural differences (eg "paused" behaviour)
- ## Future Topics
	- **Portable scene format**
		- design a scene in Godot, export and import in Unity - or vice versa.
		- Requires using only portable asset types (otherwise placeholders appear).
	- **Ingame Console w/ Block commands**
		- run any block ingame
		- add runnables with blocks at runtime
