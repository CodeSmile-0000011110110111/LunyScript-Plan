- The following Blocks raise internal events and should also be available to outside code interfacing with LunyScript:
	- Object enabled state (Unity: SetActive, Godot: paused) => OnEnable/OnDisable
	- Component enabled state => OnComponentEnable/OnComponentDisable
		- Note: needs design (ignore for now)
	- Instantiate/Destroy => OnCreate/OnDestroy
		- prefabs (user provides resource path or reference)
		- primitives (user provides primitive type via enum)
		- "empty" or built-in template objects (Unity: new GameObject, Godot: new Node)
	- Spawn/Despawn => OnSpawn/OnDespawn (get from and return to pool)
- Object Lifecycle Tracking
	- Godot: use global callbacks
	- Unity: rely on using internal blocks (raise relevant events), may add state-tracking later
- ContextRegistry
	- must provide fast access to script by engine-native object
-
- Lifecycle Event Handling
	- Objects created during a frame:
		- OnCreate => runs immediately
		- OnEnable => runs immediately
		- OnUpdate, OnLateUpdate => deferred until next frame
			- Note: this should be configurable to enable running whatever lifecycle update events follow the current event (follows Unity's model):
				- created in OnFixedStep => runs OnUpdate + OnLateUpdate
				- created in OnUpdate => runs OnLateUpdate
				- created in OnLateUpdate => no updates until next frame
	- Objects destroyed during a frame:
		- OnDisable => runs immediately
		- OnUpdate, OnLateUpdate => don't run the "next" update (dependent on order of execution)
		- OnDestroy => deferred, runs at end of frame
	- Objects enabled during a frame:
		- OnEnable => runs immediately
		- OnFixedStep, OnUpdate, OnLateUpdate => ??
	- Objects disabled during a frame:
		- OnDisable => runs immediately
		- OnFixedStep, OnUpdate, OnLateUpdate => don't run the "next" update  (dependent on order of execution)
