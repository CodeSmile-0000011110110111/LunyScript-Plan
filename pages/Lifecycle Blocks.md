- The following Blocks raise internal events and should also be available to outside code interfacing with LunyScript:
	- Object enabled state (Unity: SetActive, Godot: paused) => OnEnable/OnDisable
	- Component enabled state => OnComponentEnable/OnComponentDisable
		- Note: needs design (ignore for now)
	- Instantiate/Destroy => OnCreate/OnDestroy
		- prefabs (user provides resource path or reference)
		- primitives (user provides primitive type via enum)
		- "empty" or built-in template objects (Unity: new GameObject, Godot: new Node)
	- Spawn/Despawn => OnSpawn/OnDespawn (get from and return to pool)
- Object Lifecycle Tracking
	- Godot: use global callbacks
	- Unity: rely on using internal blocks (raise relevant events), may add state-tracking later
- ContextRegistry
	- must provide fast access to script by engine-native object
-
- Lifecycle Event Handling
	- Objects created during a frame:
		- OnCreate => runs immediately
		- OnEnable => runs immediately
		- OnReady => next frame (runs once per lifetime, before OnUpdate and before OnFixedStep if the fixed step event runs in the current frame)
		- OnFixedStep => next frame
		- OnUpdate => next frame
		- OnLateUpdate => next frame
		- Note: this should be configurable to enable running whatever lifecycle update events follow the current event (follows Unity's model):
			- created in OnFixedStep => runs OnReady, OnUpdate, OnLateUpdate
			- created in OnUpdate => runs OnReady, OnLateUpdate (awkward but so be it)
			- created in OnLateUpdate => next frame, same as above
	- Objects destroyed during a frame:
		- current event runs to completion (destroy self onlyobject processing is single-threaded, but if it were)
		- OnDisable => runs immediately
		- subsequent events => won't run (see "disabled state" for the remainder of the frame)
		- OnDestroy => deferred to end of frame (after frame event processing completes, eg after all other objects have ran their OnLateUpdate)
	- Objects disabled during a frame:
		- OnDisable => runs immediately
		- subsequent events => won't run
		- behaviour of object and its children in disabled state:
			- not processing events (update, input, collision)
			- not participating in physics simulation
			- not rendering / not visible
	- Objects enabled during a frame (after being disabled before):
		- OnEnable => runs immediately
		- subsequent events => next frame (same as for create; OnReady does **not** run again)
	- Object created and disabled in same frame, or disabled/enabled multiple times per frame:
		- runs OnDisable/OnEnable as described above
		- final state at end of frame determines event handling in next frame
	- Object destroyed while disabled:
		- OnDisable => does not run again!
		- OnDestroy => deferred to end of frame
	-
