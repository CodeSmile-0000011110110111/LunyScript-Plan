- The following Blocks raise internal events and should also be available to outside code interfacing with LunyScript:
	- Object enabled state (Unity: SetActive, Godot: paused) => OnEnable/OnDisable
	- Component enabled state => OnComponentEnable/OnComponentDisable
		- Note: needs design (ignore for now)
	- Instantiate/Destroy => OnCreate/OnDestroy
		- prefabs (user provides resource path or reference)
		- primitives (user provides primitive type via enum)
		- "empty" or built-in template objects (Unity: new GameObject, Godot: new Node)
	- Spawn/Despawn => OnSpawn/OnDespawn (get from and return to pool)
- Object Lifecycle Tracking
	- Godot: use global callbacks
	- Unity: rely on using internal blocks (raise relevant events), may add state-tracking later
- ContextRegistry
	- must provide fast access to script by engine-native object
-
- Lifecycle Event Handling
	- For objects created during a frame:
		- OnCreate => runs immediately
		- OnEnable => runs immediately
	- For objects destroyed during a frame:
		- OnDisable => runs immediately
		- OnDestroy => deferred, runs at end of frame; BUT object no longer receives "update" events for the remainder of the current frame
	- OnEnable/OnDisable => run immediately
	-
