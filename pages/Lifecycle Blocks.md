- The following Blocks raise internal events and should also be available to outside code interfacing with LunyScript:
	- Object enabled state (Unity: SetActive, Godot: paused) => OnEnable/OnDisable
	- Component enabled state => OnComponentEnable/OnComponentDisable
		- Note: needs design (ignore for now)
	- Instantiate/Destroy => OnCreate/OnDestroy
		- prefabs (user provides resource path or reference)
		- primitives (user provides primitive type via enum)
		- "empty" or built-in template objects (Unity: new GameObject, Godot: new Node)
	- Spawn/Despawn => OnSpawn/OnDespawn (get from and return to pool)
- Object Lifecycle Tracking
	- Godot: use global callbacks
	- Unity: rely on using internal blocks (raise relevant events), may add state-tracking later
- ContextRegistry
	- must provide fast access to script by engine-native object

- Lifecycle Event Handling
	- Objects created during a frame:
		- OnCreate => runs immediately
		- OnEnable => runs immediately
		- OnReady => next frame (runs once per lifetime; runs before OnUpdate and before OnFixedStep if a fixed step event occurs in the current frame)
		- OnFixedStep => next frame
		- OnUpdate => next frame
		- OnLateUpdate => next frame
		- Note: this should be configurable to enable running whatever lifecycle update events follow the current event (follows Unity's model):
			- created in OnFixedStep => runs OnReady, OnUpdate, OnLateUpdate
			- created in OnUpdate => runs OnReady, OnLateUpdate (awkward but so be it)
			- created in OnLateUpdate => next frame, same as above
	- Objects destroyed during a frame:
		- OnDisable => runs immediately
		- subsequent events => won't run
		- OnDestroy => deferred to end of frame (after "last" event, currently: OnLateUpdate)
	- Objects enabled (if disabled) during a frame:
		- OnEnable => runs immediately
		- subsequent events => next frame (same as for create; OnReady does **not** run again)
	- Objects disabled during a frame:
		- OnDisable => runs immediately
		- subsequent events => won't run (same as for "destroy")
