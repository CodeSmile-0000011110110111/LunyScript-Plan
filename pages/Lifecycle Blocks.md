- The following Blocks raise internal events and should also be available to outside code interfacing with LunyScript:
	- Enabled state (Unity: SetActive, Godot: paused) => OnEnable/OnDisable
		- Note: component enable/disable needs some thoughts (ignore for now)
	- Instantiate/Destroy => OnCreate/OnDestroy
		- prefabs (user provides resource path or reference)
		- primitives (user provides primitive type via enum)
		- "empty" or built-in template objects (Unity: new GameObject, Godot: new Node)
	- Spawn/Despawn => OnSpawn/OnDespawn (get from and return to pool)
